### I created the app using Laravel for the api and React js for the frontend.

## Installation

#### I used xampp to host the mysql, but can be changed in the api .env

### In the api:
#### Composer update
#### npm install
#### php artisan migrate:fresh --seed (to get the dbs and test data)

### In react
#### npm run start
#### * If the api is not in localhost:8000 it has to be changed in "OrderActual.jsx, OrderList.jsx, CreatePizza.jsx and PizzaList.jsx" *
